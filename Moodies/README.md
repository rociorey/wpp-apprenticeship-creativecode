### **Moodies**

------

*Moodies* allows the user to describe with words what they feel like watching and will return back a movie title for them to watch. This was created by training an algorithm  with [Netflix movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shivamb/netflix-shows-and-movies-exploratory-analysis)'s movie description data through Naive Bayes Classifier.



- *What worked*: getting the CSV data in and playing around with it. Creating classifier based in the different data columns.
- *What didn't work*: improving the classifier by adding keywords. Maybe movies are too different from one another to classify them in the way I'm doing.
